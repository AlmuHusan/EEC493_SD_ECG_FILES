This is the main code for our CNN

For those who need some rescources to help understand how machine learning 
worked we used these two courses:

Machine Learning & Deep Learning Fundamentals:

Neural Network Programming - Deep Learning with PyTorch:

In order to run our program we used Amazon Web Services (AWS), but you can use any other
cloud instance like azure or google cloud as long as it contains a gpu.

Just make sure you have pytorched installed before running it!
